# Memory Banks

This workspace uses the **Memory/** directory to store project-specific memory, execution histories, and context cards.

- `Memory/Projects/` — per-project context and artifacts
- `Memory/Execution/` — execution summaries and mission reports
- `Memory/Reports/` — archived reports and notes

Use `exoctl` and the CLI to manage the Memory Banks.
