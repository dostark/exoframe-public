# ExoFrame Knowledge Vault

This directory is the **physical memory** of your ExoFrame system. It is designed to work seamlessly with **Obsidian**
as your knowledge management interface.

## Directory Structure

### `/Context` (Read-Only Memory)

Store reference documents, rules, architecture diagrams, and any knowledge that agents should **read** but not modify.
Examples:

- `coding_standards.md` - Team coding conventions
- `architecture_overview.md` - System design docs
- `api_reference.md` - Third-party API documentation

**Best Practice:** Use Obsidian's wiki-links (`[[filename]]`) to cross-reference documents.

### `/Reports` (Write-Only Memory)

Agents write execution reports here after completing tasks. Each report is timestamped and linked to a trace ID.
Examples:

- `2025-01-15_abc123_feature-login.md` - Report for login feature implementation
- `2025-01-16_def456_bugfix-auth.md` - Report for authentication bug fix

**Note:** These are auto-generated by agents. You can read them in Obsidian but should not manually edit them.

### `/Portals` (Auto-Generated Context Cards)

When you mount an external project using `exoctl portal add`, a context card is auto-generated here. Examples:

- `MyApp.md` - Context card for the MyApp portal
- `ClientWebsite.md` - Context card for a client project

Each card contains:

- Target path
- Detected tech stack
- User notes section (editable)

## Using with Obsidian

1. **Open this vault:**
   - In Obsidian: `File → Open folder as vault`
   - Select: `/path/to/ExoFrame/Knowledge`

2. **Install recommended plugins:**
   - **Dataview** - Query and display task metadata
   - **File Tree Alternative** - Browse the folder structure

3. **Pin the Dashboard:**
   - Open `Dashboard.md` (if exists)
   - Right-click tab → Pin

4. **Work with agents:**
   - Create Context docs for agents to reference
   - Link related docs using `[[wikilinks]]`
   - Review Reports after agents complete tasks

## Tips

- **Tag your Context docs:** Use `#reference`, `#guide`, `#architecture` tags for better organization
- **Keep Context concise:** Agents have token limits; favor clarity over verbosity
- **Review Reports regularly:** They contain valuable insights into what agents did and why
