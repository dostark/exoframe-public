# ExoFrame Dashboard

Welcome to your ExoFrame workspace. This dashboard provides a live overview of your agent activity using Dataview queries.

> **Note:** Install the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin to see live tables instead of code blocks.

---

## Pending Requests

Requests waiting for agent processing:

```dataview
TABLE 
  status AS "Status",
  priority AS "Priority",
  agent AS "Agent",
  file.ctime AS "Created"
FROM "Inbox/Requests"
WHERE status = "pending" OR !status
SORT file.ctime DESC
LIMIT 10
```

---

## Plans Awaiting Review

Plans generated by agents that need human approval:

```dataview
TABLE
  status AS "Status",
  trace_id AS "Trace ID",
  file.mtime AS "Updated"
FROM "System/Plans" OR "Inbox/Plans"
WHERE status = "review" OR status = "pending"
SORT file.mtime DESC
LIMIT 10
```

---

## Recent Activity

Recently modified files across your workspace:

```dataview
TABLE
  file.folder AS "Location",
  file.mtime AS "Modified"
FROM "Inbox" OR "Knowledge" OR "System"
WHERE file.mtime >= date(today) - dur(7 days)
SORT file.mtime DESC
LIMIT 15
```

---

## Active Portals

Your connected project portals:

```dataview
LIST
FROM "Portals"
WHERE file.name != "README"
SORT file.name ASC
```

---
