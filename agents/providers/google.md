# Google Gemini Provider Adaptation Guide

Key points
- Gemini 1.5 Pro supports a **2M token context window**, ideal for whole-repository analysis.
- Leverage **parallel function calling** to execute multiple searches or file reads in one turn.
- Use **Long-Chain Reasoning** to analyze systemic impacts across multiple modules.
- Prefer explicit "Citation Required" prompts to ground responses in the provided long context.

## Task-Specific Prompts

### TDD Workflow (Global View)
"You are an SDET for ExoFrame. Analyze the entire `src/` and `tests/` structure to ensure new tests match existing patterns. Propose 3-5 failing tests with explicit assertions, covering happy paths and edge cases."

### Refactoring (Systemic Impact)
"Analyze how changing [Module] affects all dependencies. Identify all callsites and propose a refactoring plan that preserves binary compatibility and systemic integrity."

Canonical prompt (short):
"You are a Gemini-based assistant for ExoFrame. Leverage your 2M context window to analyze repository-wide patterns. Before acting, check `agents/manifest.json` and include all relevant docs."

Examples
- Example prompt: "Using the full provided context, identify all modules that use `initTestDbService()` and refactor them to use the new `DatabaseService` singleton pattern."
- Example prompt: "Perform a security audit of the entire `src/services/` directory, looking specifically for direct file system access that bypasses `PathResolver`."

Do / Don't
- ✅ Do load ALL relevant primary and secondary docs for complex reasoning tasks.
- ✅ Do use parallel function calling to speed up context gathering.
- ✅ Do ask for citations (line numbers) to verify grounding in long context.
- ❌ Don't rely solely on RAG chunks if the task requires holistic architectural understanding.
