# Review-Research-Improvement Pattern

A structured methodology for evaluating ExoFrame subsystems, identifying architectural weaknesses, and producing actionable improvement plans with concrete artifacts.

## When to Use

- Evaluating a concept/subsystem for quality and completeness
- Planning major architectural improvements
- Preparing for multi-phase refactoring work
- Identifying technical debt and prioritizing fixes
- Creating new templates/patterns based on state-of-the-art research

## Pattern Overview

```

  Weaknesses        Best Practices      Phased Plan       Templates
  Identified        Identified          Document          Examples
```

## Phase 1: Review (Analyze Current State)

### 1.1 Documentation Review

Read all relevant documentation:
- Primary docs in `docs/`
- Blueprints in `Blueprints/`
- README files in relevant directories
- Implementation plan sections

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Understand the stated purpose/goals
- [ ] Identify documented features vs. missing features
- [ ] Note any TODOs, FIXMEs, or acknowledged gaps

### 1.2 Implementation Analysis

Examine the actual code:
- Use `semantic_search` for relevant code patterns
- Read key service files end-to-end
- Check test coverage for behavior documentation
- Look for inconsistencies between docs and implementation

**Key Questions:**
- Does the implementation match the documentation?
- Are there unused/dead code paths?
- What error handling exists?
- What's the actual data flow?

### 1.3 Template/Example Audit

For pattern-based subsystems (Agents, Flows):
- Count existing templates
- Assess template quality and coverage
- Identify missing patterns

**Output:** List of current capabilities with gaps noted.

## Phase 2: Research (Compare to State-of-the-Art)

### 2.1 Identify Relevant Patterns

Research modern approaches for the subsystem type:

| Subsystem | Research Areas |
|-----------|---------------|
| Agents | ReAct, Reflexion, Chain-of-Thought, Tool Use |
| Flows | Multi-agent orchestration, DAG execution, transforms |
| Memory | RAG, semantic search, context windows |
| Tools | Function calling, schema validation, sandboxing |

### 2.2 Gap Analysis

Compare current implementation to best practices:

```markdown
| Feature | Current State | Best Practice | Gap |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| Feature A | Basic | Advanced | Missing X, Y |
| Feature B | None | Required | Not implemented |
| Feature C | Good | Good | None |
```

### 2.3 Document Weaknesses

Create numbered weakness list with:
- **Problem:** What's wrong or missing
- **Impact:** Why it matters
- **Evidence:** Code reference showing the issue

**Example:**
```markdown
### 1. No Self-Reflection Mechanism

**Problem:** Agents produce output in single pass without self-evaluation.

**Impact:** Quality varies; no automatic improvement loops.

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// agent_runner.ts:115 - Single-pass execution
const rawResponse = await this.modelProvider.generate(combinedPrompt);
const result = this.parseResponse(rawResponse); // Direct return
```
```

## Phase 3: Plan (Create Improvement Roadmap)

### 3.1 Planning Document Structure

Create `agents/planning/phase-N-<subsystem>-improvements.md`:

```markdown
# Phase N: <Subsystem> Improvements

**Created:** <date>
**Status:** Planning
**Priority:** High/Medium/Low
**Estimated Duration:** X weeks

---

## Executive Summary
[1-2 paragraph overview]

## Current State Analysis
[Architecture diagram, key components table]

## Identified Weaknesses
[Numbered list with problem/impact/evidence]

## Improvement Plan
[Sub-phases with tasks, success criteria]

## Implementation Priority
[Dependency graph, recommended order]

## Risk Assessment
[Risk/impact/mitigation table]

## Success Metrics
[How to measure improvement]
```

### 3.2 Sub-Phase Design

Each sub-phase should have:
- **Goal:** Single-sentence objective
- **Tasks:** Numbered implementation steps
- **Success Criteria:** Checkboxes for completion
- **Effort Estimate:** Days/hours
- **Dependencies:** Which phases must complete first

### 3.3 Documentation Phase (REQUIRED)

**Every improvement plan MUST include a dedicated Documentation Update phase.**

This phase should update:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| `docs/ExoFrame_User_Guide.md` | User-facing feature documentation |
| `docs/Building_with_AI_Agents.md` | Patterns and best practices |
| `docs/ExoFrame_Implementation_Plan.md` | Phase completion status |
| Subsystem README | Template catalog, configuration reference |

**Documentation Phase Template:**
```markdown
### Phase N.X: Documentation Update (1 day)

**Goal:** Update user-facing documentation to reflect new capabilities.

**Files to Update:**
| File | Updates Required |
|------|------------------|
| docs/ExoFrame_User_Guide.md | [Section]: [features] |
| docs/Building_with_AI_Agents.md | [patterns, examples] |
| [Subsystem]/README.md | [templates, config] |

**Tasks:**
1. Document new features with examples
2. Update CLI reference
3. Add troubleshooting section
4. Update configuration reference

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] User guide complete
- [ ] Each feature has example
- [ ] CLI documented
```

### 3.4 Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| Critical | Blocking issues, security, data integrity |
| High | Major quality/reliability improvements |
| Medium | Important features, moderate impact |
| Low | Nice-to-have, polish, minor improvements |
| **Final** | Documentation Update (always last phase) |

## Phase 4: Artifacts (Create Concrete Deliverables)

### 4.1 Templates

Create reusable templates that encode best practices:
- Place in appropriate `templates/` directory
- Include inline documentation
- Provide customization points with placeholders
- Add usage examples

**Template Structure:**
```markdown
---
[frontmatter with metadata]
---

# Template Name

## Overview
[What this template is for]

## Instructions
[How to use it]

## Output Format
[Expected structure]

## Example
[Complete worked example]

## Customization Points
[Table of placeholders]

## When to Use
[✅ Good for / ❌ Not ideal for]
```

### 4.2 Example Implementations

Create concrete examples showing the pattern in action:
- Real scenarios, not toy examples
- Complete implementations
- Comments explaining key decisions

### 4.3 Documentation Updates

Update relevant READMEs with:
- New template descriptions
- Comparison tables
- Implementation status
- Links to planning docs

## Verification Checklist

Before completing the pattern:

- [ ] Planning document committed to `agents/planning/`
- [ ] Weaknesses have code evidence (not speculation)
- [ ] Improvement phases have clear success criteria
- [ ] **Documentation Update phase included** (updates `docs/` folder)
- [ ] Templates follow existing conventions
- [ ] README files updated
- [ ] All pre-commit checks pass
- [ ] Commit message follows convention

## Example Applications

### Example 1: Flow Orchestration Review (Phase 15)

**Request:** "Review the concept of Flows, find weaknesses, create improvement plan"

**Process:**
1. **Review:** Read `Blueprints/Flows/`, `src/flows/`, examples, templates
2. **Research:** Multi-agent patterns, LLM-as-a-Judge, DAG orchestration
3. **Plan:** Created `phase-15-flow-orchestration-improvements.md`
   - Identified 8 weaknesses (dead fields, no quality gates, etc.)
   - Proposed 6 sub-phases
4. **Artifacts:**
   - `llm-judge-code-review.flow.template.ts`
   - `quality-judge.md` agent blueprint
   - Updated templates README

### Example 2: Agent Orchestration Review (Phase 16)

**Request:** "Same review-research-improvement for direct agent orchestration"

**Process:**
1. **Review:** Read `Blueprints/Agents/`, `AgentRunner`, `AgentExecutor`, templates
2. **Research:** Reflexion, ReAct, tool-use patterns, confidence scoring
3. **Plan:** Created `phase-16-agent-orchestration-improvements.md`
   - Identified 8 weaknesses (no self-reflection, weak validation, etc.)
   - Proposed 8 sub-phases
4. **Artifacts:**
   - `reflexive-agent.md.template`
   - `research-agent.md.template`
   - `judge-agent.md.template`
   - Updated templates README

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Vague weaknesses | Require code evidence for each |
| Over-scoped plans | Limit to 6-8 sub-phases |
| Missing dependencies | Draw dependency graph |
| No success criteria | Mandate checkboxes per phase |
| Orphan artifacts | Update READMEs immediately |
