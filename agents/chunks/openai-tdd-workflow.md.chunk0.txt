# OpenAI TDD Workflow (tests first)

Key points
- Start by proposing failing tests with explicit assertions.
- Use existing ExoFrame test helpers (retrieve guidance from agents/ first).
- Only then implement the minimal change to make tests pass.

Canonical prompt (short)

"You are implementing a change in ExoFrame using TDD. First, inject agents/ context for testing patterns. Then propose 2–4 failing tests with explicit assertions. After that, provide minimal file-scoped diffs to make them pass. End with verification commands. Cite agent doc paths used."
