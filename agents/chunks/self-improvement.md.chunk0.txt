# Self-improvement loop for `agents/` instructions

Key points
- Before non-trivial work, run an **Instruction Adequacy Check**: do we have enough ExoFrame-specific guidance to act and verify?
- If guidance is missing, do a **Doc Patch Loop**: add the smallest, task-scoped update to `agents/`, then rebuild/validate, then continue the primary task.
- Keep updates grounded: add checklists, examples, and commands; avoid speculative “nice-to-have” prose.
- Treat doc changes like code changes: minimal diff, clear success criteria, and a regression test when appropriate.

## Instruction adequacy check

Use this at the start of a session or before a multi-step change.
