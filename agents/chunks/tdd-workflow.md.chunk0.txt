# TDD Workflow Prompt Example

## Prompt Template

```
I need to [add feature / fix bug / refactor code] for [component name].

Before you start:
1. Search agents/ for relevant patterns: "TDD testing [component area]"
2. Read the Implementation Plan to find/create the step
3. Review existing tests in tests/ to understand patterns

Then follow TDD workflow:
1. Write failing test first (use initTestDbService() if needed)
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Refactor and verify coverage maintained
4. Update Implementation Plan step as [x] completed

Context injection command:
deno run --allow-read scripts/inject_agent_context.ts claude "TDD testing [component]" 6
