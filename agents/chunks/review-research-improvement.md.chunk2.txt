**Checklist:**
- [ ] Understand the stated purpose/goals
- [ ] Identify documented features vs. missing features
- [ ] Note any TODOs, FIXMEs, or acknowledged gaps

### 1.2 Implementation Analysis

Examine the actual code:
- Use `semantic_search` for relevant code patterns
- Read key service files end-to-end
- Check test coverage for behavior documentation
- Look for inconsistencies between docs and implementation

**Key Questions:**
- Does the implementation match the documentation?
- Are there unused/dead code paths?
- What error handling exists?
- What's the actual data flow?

### 1.3 Template/Example Audit

For pattern-based subsystems (Agents, Flows):
- Count existing templates
- Assess template quality and coverage
- Identify missing patterns
