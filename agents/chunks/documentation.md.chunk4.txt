All documentation changes MUST be coordinated with implementation: verify refined Implementation Plan step exists and add TDD test cases when defining new behavior.

### Implementation Plan Structure

Each step MUST include dependencies, rollback, action, justification, TDD test cases, and measurable Success Criteria. Use step status markers (COMPLETED, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED) to track progress.

### Version Synchronization

Documents that share version numbers MUST be updated together. Add a checklist for updating versions and release dates.

### Terminology Consistency

Maintain a standard Terminology Reference and link to it from major documents. Use consistent capitalization and add new terms to the reference when needed.

### Formatting Standards
