- The Refinement Loop: request refinement of Implementation Plan steps before implementing; ensure success criteria are measurable.
- Documentation Cleanup: remove planning artifacts from code; keep history in git and planning docs.

### Test-Driven Documentation

All documentation changes MUST be coordinated with implementation: verify refined Implementation Plan step exists and add TDD test cases when defining new behavior.

### Implementation Plan Structure

Each step MUST include dependencies, rollback, action, justification, TDD test cases, and measurable Success Criteria. Use step status markers (COMPLETED, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED) to track progress.
