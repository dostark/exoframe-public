# Self-improvement loop (prompt template)

Key points
- Use this when you suspect the current `agents/` instructions are insufficient for the active task.
- It forces: adequacy verdict → gaps list → minimal doc patch → rebuild/validate → resume.
- Keep the doc patch tightly scoped to the user’s request.

Canonical prompt (short)
"Run an Instruction Adequacy Check against agents/ for this task. If guidance is missing, propose and apply the smallest update to agents/ docs/templates/cross-reference to close the gap, then rebuild manifest/chunks/embeddings and validate agent docs before continuing the primary task."
