# Claude RAG Usage Guide

## Overview

ExoFrame pre-computes embeddings for all agent documentation, enabling semantic search and automatic context injection for Claude-powered workflows. This guide shows how to leverage the embeddings infrastructure to provide Claude with the most relevant context for any task.

## RAG Workflow

1. **Generate query embedding** for user's task (or use mock vector based on query text)
2. **Rank chunks** by cosine similarity against pre-computed embeddings
3. **Inject top 4-6 chunks** into Claude system prompt (within 200k token budget)
4. **Execute task** with enriched context

## Tools

### Inspect Embeddings

Find best matching chunks for a query using cosine similarity:
