# OpenAI RAG Usage Guide

Key points
- Use RAG by default: retrieve agents/ context before proposing code changes.
- Prefer inspect → inject: preview matches, then inject the top chunks.
- Start small: 2–3 chunks for simple tasks, 4–6 for standard, 8–10 only for complex work.
- If docs changed, rebuild manifest/chunks and embeddings before trusting retrieval results.

## Overview

ExoFrame precomputes embeddings for all agent documentation in `agents/` and splits docs into `agents/chunks/*.txt` for retrieval. This guide shows a predictable, tool-centric workflow to provide OpenAI models (gpt-4o family) the most relevant ExoFrame context with minimal prompt bloat.
