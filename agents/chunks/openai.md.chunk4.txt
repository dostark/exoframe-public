Self-improvement loop
- If you discover an instruction gap mid-task (missing examples, missing commands, missing invariants), patch `agents/` as part of the work:
	- Process: `agents/process/self-improvement.md`
	- Template: `agents/prompts/self-improvement-loop.md`
- Keep the patch minimal and task-scoped; rebuild/validate `agents/` artifacts before continuing.
