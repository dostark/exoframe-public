1. CONTEXT INJECTION:
   deno run --allow-read scripts/inject_agent_context.ts claude "debugging PathResolver Portal permissions" 8

2. REPRODUCE:
   - Write test: new PathResolver(portalId).resolve("valid/path")
   - Run test to confirm "Permission denied" error
   - Show exact error message and path that fails

3. DIAGNOSE:
   <thinking>
   - Expected: Valid paths within Portal should resolve
   - Actual: Permission denied even for valid paths
   - Gap: Permission check logic might be too restrictive
   - Files: src/services/PathResolver.ts, Portal config validation
   </thinking>

4. FIX:
   - Read PathResolver permission logic
   - Check Portal config parsing
   - Fix validation to allow valid paths
   - Verify test passes
