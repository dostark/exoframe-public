- Headers must include version, release date, status, and references
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Use consistent table formatting

### Cross-Reference Guidelines

Use relative paths for internal links and include file paths when referencing code. Keep documentation changes minimal and tied to Implementation Plan steps.
