Solution:
- Wrapped all test bodies in try/finally blocks
- Moved cleanup() calls to finally blocks
- Added helper assertWithCleanup() to tests/helpers/db.ts for reuse

Testing:
- All tests in tests/config_test.ts now pass
- No resource leak warnings
- Coverage maintained at 85%

## Example Usage (Refactoring)

**User:**
```
I extracted database initialization into a reusable helper. Create a detailed commit message.

Before creating the commit:
1. git status shows: tests/helpers/db.ts, 12 test files updated
2. git diff shows new initTestDb() helper, import changes
3. No Implementation Plan step - this is technical debt reduction

Create commit message:

Component: tests
Type: refactor
```

**Expected Response:**
