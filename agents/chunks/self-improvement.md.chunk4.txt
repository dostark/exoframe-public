- **Missing examples**: no concrete ExoFrame-specific snippet for the task.
- **Missing commands**: no “what to run” for verification/build/validation.

- **Missing cross-links**: docs exist but are hard to discover.
- **Missing provider mapping**: advice exists but doesn’t translate to Claude/OpenAI/Gemini workflow.
- **Missing tests**: doc changes not guarded; regressions likely.
