# Claude Provider Adaptation Guide

## Overview

Claude 3.5 Sonnet provides a 200k context window and excellent reasoning capabilities. This guide provides task-specific prompt templates (including TDD test patterns), thinking protocols, and tool-use patterns optimized for ExoFrame development.

## Self-improvement loop

When Claude lacks enough ExoFrame-specific guidance to proceed safely, patch `agents/` during the task (minimal + test-backed), then continue.

- Process: `agents/process/self-improvement.md`
- Copy/paste template: `agents/prompts/self-improvement-loop.md`
- Claude-specific tip: use the thinking protocol to (1) list concrete instruction gaps, (2) propose the smallest doc patch, (3) rebuild/validate `agents/` artifacts, then (4) resume the primary task.
