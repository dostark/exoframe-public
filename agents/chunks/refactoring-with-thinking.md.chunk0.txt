# Refactoring with Thinking Protocol Prompt

## Prompt Template

```
I need to refactor [component/pattern] to [goal].

Use your thinking protocol:

<thinking>
1. ANALYZE: Read relevant files, check dependencies, identify risks
2. PLAN: List tool calls needed (parallel reads where possible)
3. EXECUTE: Make changes incrementally
4. SYNTHESIZE: Verify tests pass, coverage maintained
5. VERIFY: Check Implementation Plan requirements met
</thinking>
