# OpenAI provider adaptation notes

Key points
- Default model: gpt-4o (128k). If constrained, use gpt-4o-mini for drafting then verify with gpt-4o.
- Retrieve context before coding: inject 3-6 chunks from agents/ with `inject_agent_context.ts --agent openai`.
- Keep responses within explicit budgets: simple 500 tokens, standard 900, complex 1500; summarize aggressively.
- Prefer tool-aware answers: propose file + line edits, then show minimal diff or apply_patch-ready snippets.
- Always cite which agent doc(s) you used (by path) to reinforce reuse.
