## Example Usage

**User:**
```
I need to add input validation for Portal configuration files.

Before you start:
1. Search agents/ for relevant patterns: "TDD testing validation Portal"
2. Read the Implementation Plan step for Portal validation
3. Review existing tests in tests/portal_permissions_test.ts

Then follow TDD workflow:
1. Write failing test first (test malformed YAML, missing required fields)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (validation schema)
3. Refactor and verify coverage maintained
4. Update Implementation Plan step as [x] completed
