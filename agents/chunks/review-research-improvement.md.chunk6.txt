## Implementation Priority
[Dependency graph, recommended order]

## Risk Assessment
[Risk/impact/mitigation table]

## Success Metrics
[How to measure improvement]
```

### 3.2 Sub-Phase Design

Each sub-phase should have:
- **Goal:** Single-sentence objective
- **Tasks:** Numbered implementation steps
- **Success Criteria:** Checkboxes for completion
- **Effort Estimate:** Days/hours
- **Dependencies:** Which phases must complete first

### 3.3 Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| Critical | Blocking issues, security, data integrity |
| High | Major quality/reliability improvements |
| Medium | Important features, moderate impact |
| Low | Nice-to-have, polish, minor improvements |
