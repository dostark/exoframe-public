1. **List the gaps** (actionable, not vague)
   - Examples:
     - “No guidance on which test helper to use for this subsystem.”
     - “No canonical command for validating manifest/chunks after agents/ edits.”
     - “No example of the required output format for this provider in this scenario.”

2. **Choose the smallest fix**
   - Add a section to an existing doc when the topic clearly belongs there.
   - Add a prompt template when the goal is reliable behavior (format/budgets/checklists).
   - Add a cross-reference row/topic when discovery is the main problem.

3. **Apply the doc patch (minimal diff)**
   - Keep changes directly relevant to the current user request.
   - Prefer checklists + examples over long narrative.
