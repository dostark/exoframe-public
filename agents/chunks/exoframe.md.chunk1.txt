Philosophy & Workflow
- **Refinement Loop (Critical)**: Before implementing, ask the agent to "Refine" a step with success criteria, examples, and error cases. If you can't write clear success criteria, you aren't ready to code.
- **Walking Skeleton**: Build end-to-end minimal features (e.g., config -> db -> log -> watcher) rather than perfect isolated components. "Can I demo this?" should always be YES.
- **Config Philosophy**: Every magic number should be a config option. Ask agents to measure first, then expose tradeoffs as config.
- **Question->Action Loop**: Ask questions -> Agent investigates -> You decide -> Agent implements. Don't let the agent guess.
