# OpenAI Quickstart: Use agents/ first

Key points
- Always retrieve relevant context from `agents/` before proposing changes.
- Keep output small and actionable: diffs first, then verification.
- If requirements are unclear, ask 1–3 clarifying questions before editing.

Canonical prompt (short)

"You are an OpenAI coding assistant for ExoFrame. Before acting, retrieve context from agents/ using inject_agent_context (2–3 chunks simple, 4–6 standard, 8–10 complex). Output format is mandatory: Files → Plan → Diffs → Verification. Cite agent doc paths used. Ask clarifying questions if ambiguous."
