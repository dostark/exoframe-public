4. IMPLEMENT (one criterion at a time):
   FIRST: Path traversal tests
   - Write test for ../ attempts
   - Verify PathResolver blocks them
   - Mark [ ] → [x]

SECOND: Symlink escape tests
   - Write test for symlink detection
   - Verify Portal config validates
   - Mark [ ] → [x]

(Continue for each criterion...)

5. VERIFY:
   After each criterion:
   - Run: deno test tests/portal_permissions_test.ts
   - Check that specific test passes

After all criteria:
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify coverage ≥80%

6. MARK COMPLETE:
   - Update all checkboxes in Step 6.7
   - Note: Added helper assertPathBlocked() for reuse

Phase: 6
Step: 6.7
Feature: Portal security testing
