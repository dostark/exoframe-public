Do / Don't
- ✅ Do load ALL relevant primary and secondary docs for complex reasoning tasks.
- ✅ Do use parallel function calling to speed up context gathering.
- ✅ Do ask for citations (line numbers) to verify grounding in long context.
- ❌ Don't rely solely on RAG chunks if the task requires holistic architectural understanding.
