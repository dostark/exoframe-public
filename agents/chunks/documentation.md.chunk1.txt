### 3. The Living Plan Principle
The `ExoFrame_Implementation_Plan.md` is not a static roadmap; it is a mutable artifact.
- **Extend on Discovery**: If a task reveals new complexity, add a new sub-step (e.g., `Step 10.3`).
- **Document Before Coding**: Never write code for a feature that isn't in the plan. Write the step first.
- **Structure**: Follow the existing format (Goal, Action items, Success Criteria).
