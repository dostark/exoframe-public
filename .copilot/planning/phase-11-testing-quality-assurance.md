## Phase 11: Testing & Quality Assurance

> **Status:** 🏗️ IN PROGRESS (Steps 11.1-11.9 ✅ COMPLETED)\
> **Prerequisites:** Phases 1–10 (Runtime, Events, Intelligence, Tools, Obsidian, Portal, Flows, LLM Providers, UX, Polishing)\
> **Goal:** Validate single-agent and multi-agent workflows end-to-end with both local and cloud providers.

📄 **Full Documentation:** [`ExoFrame_Testing_and_CI_Strategy.md`](./ExoFrame_Testing_and_CI_Strategy.md)

### Overview

Phase 10 establishes the testing infrastructure needed to confidently ship ExoFrame with Flow orchestration and multi-provider support. The comprehensive testing strategy is documented in a dedicated document that covers:

- **Testing Pyramid** — Unit, Integration, Security, Performance, Manual QA
- **Mock LLM Infrastructure** — Deterministic testing without API costs
- **v1.0 Testing Scope** — What's included and excluded from initial release
- **Pre-Release Checklist** — Sign-off template for each major release

### Steps Summary

| Step | Description                   | Location             | Status      |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| 11.1 | Unit Tests (Core Services)    | `tests/*_test.ts`    | ✅ Complete |
| 11.2 | Obsidian Integration Tests    | `tests/obsidian/`    | ✅ Complete |
| 11.3 | CLI Command Tests             | `tests/cli/`         | ✅ Complete |
| 11.4 | Integration Test Scenarios    | `tests/integration/` | ✅ Complete |
| 11.5 | Documentation Structure Tests | `tests/docs/`        | ✅ Complete |
| 11.6 | Flow Execution Tests          | `tests/flows/`       | ✅ Complete |
| 11.7 | Security Validation Tests     | `tests/security/`    | ✅ Complete |
| 11.8 | Performance Benchmarks        | `tests/benchmarks/`  | 🔲 Planned  |
| 11.9 | Manual QA Checklist           | Testing Strategy §4  | 🔲 Planned  |

**Note:** Lease management is integrated into `src/services/execution_loop.ts` (not a separate service).
Tests for lease acquisition/release are in `tests/execution_loop_test.ts`.

### Exit Criteria
