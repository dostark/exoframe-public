## Phase 4: The Hands (Tools & Git) ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Agents execute actions securely and robustly.

### Step 4.1: The Tool Registry ✅ COMPLETED

- **Dependencies:** Steps 3.1-3.4 (Model Adapter, Agent Runner, Context Loader, Plan Writer)
- **Action:** Implement tool registry that maps LLM function calls (JSON) to safe Deno operations (`read_file`,
  `write_file`, `run_command`, `list_directory`).
- **Requirement:** Tools must be sandboxed within allowed paths and enforce security policies from Step 2.3.
- **Justification:** Enables agents to execute concrete actions while maintaining security boundaries.

**The Solution:** Create a `ToolRegistry` service that:

1. Registers available tools with JSON schemas (for LLM function calling)
2. Validates tool invocations against security policies
3. Executes tools within sandboxed context (Deno permissions, path restrictions)
4. Logs all tool executions to Activity Journal
5. Returns structured results for LLM to interpret

**Core Tools:**

- `read_file(path: string)` - Read file content within allowed paths
- `write_file(path: string, content: string)` - Write/modify files
- `list_directory(path: string)` - List directory contents
- `run_command(command: string, args: string[])` - Execute shell commands (restricted)
- `search_files(pattern: string, path: string)` - Search for files/content

**Security Requirements:**

- All paths must be validated through `PathResolver` (Step 2.3)
- Commands must be whitelisted (no arbitrary shell execution)
- Tool execution must be logged with trace_id for audit (non-blocking batched writes)
- Failures must return structured errors (not raw exceptions)

**Success Criteria:**

- LLM outputting `{"tool": "read_file", "path": "Knowledge/docs.md"}` triggers file read
- Path traversal attempts (`../../etc/passwd`) are rejected
- Tool execution logged to Activity Journal with trace_id
- Restricted commands (`rm -rf /`) are blocked

### Step 4.2: Git Integration (Identity Aware) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Dependencies:** Step 4.1 (Tool Registry)
- **Action:** Implement `GitService` class for managing agent-created branches and commits.
- **Requirement:** All agent changes must be tracked in git with trace_id linking back to original request.
- **Justification:** Provides audit trail, enables rollback, and integrates with standard PR review workflow.

**The Solution:** Create a `GitService` that:

1. Auto-initializes git repository if not present
2. Auto-configures git identity (user.name, user.email) if missing
3. Creates feature branches with naming convention: `feat/{requestId}-{traceId}`
4. Commits changes with trace_id in commit message footer
5. Handles branch name conflicts (appends timestamp if needed)
6. Validates changes exist before attempting commit

**Branch Naming Convention:**

```
feat/implement-auth-550e8400
feat/fix-bug-abc12345
```

**Commit Message Format:**

```
Implement authentication system

Created login handler, JWT tokens, and user session management.

[ExoTrace: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000]
```

**Error Handling:**

- Repository not initialized → auto-run `git init` + empty commit
- Identity not configured → use default bot identity (`bot@exoframe.local`)
- Branch already exists → append timestamp to make unique
- No changes to commit → throw clear error (don't create empty commit)
- Git command failures → wrap in descriptive error with command context

**Success Criteria:**

- Run in non-git directory → auto-initializes with initial commit
- Run with no git config → auto-configures bot identity
- Create branch twice with same name → second gets unique name
- Attempt commit with no changes → throws clear error
- Commit message includes trace_id footer for audit
- All git operations logged to Activity Journal

### Step 4.3: The Execution Loop (Resilient) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Dependencies:** Steps 4.1–4.2 (Tool Registry, Git Integration) — **Rollback:** pause queue processing through config
  and replay from last clean snapshot.
- **Action:** Implement execution loop that processes active tasks from `/System/Active` with comprehensive error
  handling.
- **Requirement:** All execution paths (success or failure) must be logged, and users must receive clear feedback.
- **Justification:** Ensures system resilience and user visibility into agent operations.

**The Solution:** Create an `ExecutionLoop` service that:

1. Monitors `/System/Active` for approved plans
2. Acquires lease on active task file (prevents concurrent execution)
3. Executes plan using Tool Registry and Git Service
4. Handles both success and failure paths with appropriate reporting
5. Cleans up resources (releases leases, closes connections)

**Execution Flow:**

```
Agent creates plan → /Inbox/Plans/{requestId}_plan.md (status: review)
  ↓
[HUMAN REVIEWS PLAN IN OBSIDIAN]
  ↓
  ├─ APPROVE: Move plan → /System/Active/{requestId}.md
  │   └─ Log: plan.approved (action_type, trace_id, actor: 'human')
  │
  ├─ REJECT: Move plan → /Inbox/Rejected/{requestId}_rejected.md
  │   ├─ Add frontmatter: rejection_reason, rejected_by, rejected_at
  │   └─ Log: plan.rejected (action_type, trace_id, actor: 'human', metadata: reason)
  │
  └─ REQUEST CHANGES: Add comments to plan file, keep in /Inbox/Plans
      ├─ Append "## Review Comments" section to plan
      ├─ Update frontmatter: status: 'needs_revision', reviewed_by, reviewed_at
      └─ Log: plan.revision_requested (action_type, trace_id, actor: 'human', metadata: comments)

      Agent responds: reads comments → generates revised plan
        ├─ Update plan in-place or create new version
        └─ Log: plan.revised (action_type, trace_id, actor: 'agent')
  ↓
/System/Active/{requestId}.md detected by ExecutionLoop
  ↓
Acquire lease (or skip if locked)
  ↓
Load plan + context
  ↓
Create git branch (feat/{requestId}-{traceId})
  ↓
Execute tools (wrapped in try/catch)
  ↓
  ├─ SUCCESS:
  │   ├─ Commit changes to branch
  │   ├─ Generate Mission Report → /Knowledge/Reports
  │   ├─ Archive plan → /Inbox/Archive
  │   └─ Log: execution.completed (trace_id, actor: 'agent', metadata: files_changed)
  │
  │   [HUMAN REVIEWS PULL REQUEST]
  │     ↓
  │     ├─ APPROVE: Merge PR to main
  │     │   └─ Log: pr.merged (trace_id, actor: 'human', metadata: commit_sha)
  │     │
  │     └─ REJECT: Close PR without merging
  │         └─ Log: pr.rejected (trace_id, actor: 'human', metadata: reason)
  │
  └─ FAILURE:
      ├─ Rollback git changes (reset branch)
      ├─ Generate Failure Report → /Knowledge/Reports
      ├─ Move plan back → /Inbox/Requests (status: error)
      └─ Log: execution.failed (trace_id, actor: 'system', metadata: error_details)
  ↓
Release lease
```

**Human Review Actions:**

1. **Approve Plan**
   - Action: Move file from `/Inbox/Plans/{requestId}_plan.md` to `/System/Active/{requestId}.md`
   - Logging: Insert activity record with `action_type: 'plan.approved'`, `actor: 'human'`

2. **Reject Plan**
   - Action: Move file to `/Inbox/Rejected/{requestId}_rejected.md`
   - Add to frontmatter:
     ```toml
     status = "rejected"
     rejected_by = "user@example.com"
     rejected_at = "2024-11-25T15:30:00Z"
     rejection_reason = "Approach is too risky, use incremental strategy instead"
     ```
   - Logging: Insert activity record with `action_type: 'plan.rejected'`, `actor: 'human'`, `metadata: {reason: "..."}`

3. **Request Changes**
   - Action: Edit plan file in-place, append comments section:
     ```markdown
     ## Review Comments

     **Reviewed by:** user@example.com\
     **Reviewed at:** 2024-11-25T15:30:00Z

     - ❌ Don't modify the production database directly
     - ⚠️ Need to add rollback migration
     - ✅ Login handler looks good
     - 💡 Consider adding rate limiting to prevent brute force
     ```
   - Update frontmatter:
     ```toml
     status = "needs_revision"
     reviewed_by = "user@example.com"
     reviewed_at = "2024-11-25T15:30:00Z"
     ```
   - Logging: Insert activity record with `action_type: 'plan.revision_requested'`, `actor: 'human'`,
     `metadata: {comment_count: 4}`

**Activity Logging:**

All actions in the execution loop are logged using `DatabaseService.logActivity()`. The current implementation uses direct method calls for activity logging. All logs are batched and written asynchronously for performance.

**Query Examples:**

```sql
-- Get all human review actions for a trace
SELECT action_type, metadata->>'reviewed_by', timestamp
FROM activity
WHERE trace_id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
  AND actor = 'human'
ORDER BY timestamp;

-- Find plans awaiting human review
SELECT entity_id, timestamp
FROM activity
WHERE action_type = 'plan.created'
  AND entity_id NOT IN (
    SELECT entity_id FROM activity
    WHERE action_type IN ('plan.approved', 'plan.rejected')
  )
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Get rejection rate
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE action_type = 'plan.rejected') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as rejection_rate
FROM activity
WHERE action_type IN ('plan.approved', 'plan.rejected');
```

**Failure Report Format:**

```markdown
+++
trace_id = "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
request_id = "implement-auth"
status = "failed"
failed_at = "2024-11-25T12:00:00Z"
error_type = "ToolExecutionError"
+++

# Failure Report: Implement Authentication

## Error Summary

Execution failed during tool operation: write_file

## Error Details
```

PermissionDenied: write access to /etc/passwd is not allowed at PathResolver.validatePath
(src/services/path_resolver.ts:45) at ToolRegistry.executeTool (src/services/tool_registry.ts:89)

## Execution Context

- Agent: senior-coder
- Branch: feat/implement-auth-550e8400
- Tools executed before failure: read_file (3), list_directory (1)
- Last successful operation: Read /Knowledge/API_Spec.md

## Next Steps

1. Review the error and adjust the request
2. Move corrected request back to /Inbox/Requests
3. System will retry execution
