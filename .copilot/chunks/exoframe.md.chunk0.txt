# ExoFrame — Copilot quick reference

Purpose
- Provide concise, high-value context for Copilot or Copilot Labs when working on development tasks.

Quick notes
- Runtime: Deno, TypeScript
- Key code paths: `src/ai/`, `src/services/`, `Flows/`, `Blueprints/Agents/`
- Tests: `tests/` (use `initTestDbService()` and `createCliTestContext()` helpers)

Canonical prompt (short):
"You are a repository-aware coding assistant for ExoFrame. Read the `.copilot/manifest.json` and include any `short_summary` matches before replying. When proposing code, prefer existing helpers and tests, and add unit tests for behavior changes."

Examples
- "Add a test that verifies PlanWriter handles empty JSON files"
- "Migrate test X to use initTestDbService()"
