Key points
- **Saturation Strategy**: Load all relevant documentation and source code to provide a "complete picture" for reasoning.
- **MEC (Maximum Effective Context)**: Aim for 50k-500k tokens for architectural work to maintain high instruction following.
- **RAG-as-a-Filter**: Use semantic search to identify which *files* to load in full, rather than just using chunks.
- **Structural Delimiters**: Use clear headers (e.g., `# FILE: src/main.ts`) to help the agent navigate the large window.
