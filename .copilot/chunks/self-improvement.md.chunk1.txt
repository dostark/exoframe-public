2. **Retrieve relevant instructions**
   - Start with `agents/cross-reference.md` to find the primary docs.
   - Read the provider guide for the active model:
     - Claude: `agents/providers/claude.md`
     - OpenAI: `agents/providers/openai.md`
     - Google: `agents/providers/google.md`
   - Inject additional docs via `scripts/inject_agent_context.ts` when needed.

3. **Adequacy verdict**
   - ✅ Adequate if the docs specify:
     - what files/patterns to use (ExoFrame-specific)
     - what invariants to preserve
     - what verification to run (tests/lint/CI checks)
   - ❌ Inadequate if any of these are missing or ambiguous.
