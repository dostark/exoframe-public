### System Constraints & Patterns
- **Runtime Persistence**: The .exo/Active, Workspace/Requests, and Workspace/Plans folders are the "Database". Code must respect file-system atomicity (use `writeTextFile` with atomic renaming where possible).
- **Activity Journal**: All side-effects (file writes, executions, errors) MUST be logged to the Activity Journal (`.exo/journal.db`) via `EventLogger`.
- **Security Modes**:
    - **Sandboxed**: No network, no file access (default).
    - **Hybrid**: Read-only access to specific "Portal" paths.
    - **Note**: Always use `PathResolver` to validate paths before access.
- **MCP Enforcement**: In Hybrid mode, agents can read files directly but MUST use MCP tools for writes (to ensure auditability).
