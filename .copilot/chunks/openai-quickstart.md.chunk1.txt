- Example prompt:
  "Task: Fix failing unit test in PlanWriter. First, inject agents/ context for 'PlanWriter tests' (4 chunks). Then respond in Files → Plan → Diffs → Verification format. Provide apply_patch-ready diffs only. Cite agent doc paths used."

- Example prompt:
  "Task: Add a new CLI command. Inject agents/ context for 'cli patterns' (6 chunks). Give a minimal implementation and tests. Ask 1–2 clarifying questions if command flags/behavior are unspecified."

Do / Don't
- ✅ Do cite docs used by path (e.g., agents/tests/testing.md).
- ✅ Do propose minimal diffs and separate by file.
- ❌ Don’t write long prose; keep it patch-oriented.
