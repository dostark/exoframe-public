# Gemini TDD Workflow Prompt

Key points
- Leverages long-context to find all existing **test patterns** and **helpers**.
- Drafts **5+ failing test cases** covering happy paths, errors, and systemic edge cases (concurrency, leases).
- Ensures **assertions** are exhaustive and grounded in repository physical laws.

Canonical prompt (short):
"You are a TDD specialist for ExoFrame. Analyze all existing test helpers. Propose 5+ failing test cases for [FEATURE] with detailed assertions. Implement only once tests are approved."
