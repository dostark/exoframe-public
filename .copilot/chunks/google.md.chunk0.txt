# Google Gemini Provider Adaptation Guide

Key points
- Gemini 1.5 Pro supports a **2M token context window**, ideal for whole-repository analysis.
- Leverage **parallel function calling** to execute multiple searches or file reads in one turn.
- Use **Long-Chain Reasoning** to analyze systemic impacts across multiple modules.
- Prefer explicit "Citation Required" prompts to ground responses in the provided long context.
