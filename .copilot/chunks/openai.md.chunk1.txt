Quick start (3 steps)
1) Discover: `deno run --allow-read scripts/inject_agent_context.ts openai "<query>" 4`
2) Plan: outline steps + token budget + files to touch; include a stop-and-ask decision.
3) Execute: respond with minimal diff blocks; close with verification steps (tests or lint).

Canonical prompt (short)
"You are an OpenAI coding assistant for the ExoFrame monorepo. Before acting, retrieve context from .copilot/ with inject_agent_context. Respect token budgets (simple 500, standard 900, complex 1500). Propose diffs, then give apply_patch-ready snippets. Always cite the docs you used."
