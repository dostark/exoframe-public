- Mid-level (standard, 4–6 chunks):
	"Inspect and inject 6 chunks for 'refactor service to reduce duplication'. Provide two file-scoped diffs and a short test list. Ask clarifying questions if the scope is ambiguous."

- Senior (complex, 8–10 chunks):
	"Inject 10 chunks for 'cross-cutting change across CLI + services'. Produce minimal diffs per file and a verification checklist. If you suspect stale embeddings, stop and request a rebuild before continuing."

## Embeddings modes

- Mock embeddings (default for local/dev): deterministic and fast, good enough for keyword-y matching.
- OpenAI embeddings: higher quality semantic matching (requires network + environment access).
- Precomputed embeddings: import JSON vectors under `.copilot/embeddings/` then rebuild.
