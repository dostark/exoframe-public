RAG usage for OpenAI
- Retrieval: `inject_agent_context.ts openai "<topic>" 4` (2-3 chunks simple, 4-6 standard, 8+ complex only if necessary).
- Preview before injection (optional): `inspect_embeddings.ts --agent openai --query "<topic>" --top 8`.
- Cite sources: e.g., "Used .copilot/providers/openai.md (chunks 0-1), .copilot/cross-reference.md (chunk 2)."
- When context is stale or missing, ask for a rebuild of manifest + embeddings before proceeding.

Examples (by level)

- Junior (simple, ~500 tokens):
	"Inject .copilot/ context for 'ConfigLoader TOML errors'. Propose 2 failing unit tests with explicit assertions, then provide a single file-scoped diff to make them pass. Output must follow: Files → Plan → Diffs → Verification. Cite the docs used by path."
