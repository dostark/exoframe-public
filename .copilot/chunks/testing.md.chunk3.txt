1. Search for similar test file names
2. Compare test case names for duplicates
3. Merge unique cases into canonical location
4. Delete duplicate files

### Security Tests as First-Class Citizens

Every security boundary needs explicit tests. Label security tests with `[security]` and include tests for path traversal, shell injection, network exfiltration, and env leakage.

### Database Initialization

✅ DO: Use `initTestDbService()` for DatabaseService tests. Prefer `initActivityTableSchema()` for reconnection tests and avoid raw SQL table creation in test files.

### CLI Test Context — Recommended Pattern

Use `createCliTestContext()` to centralize DB + tempdir setup for CLI tests. Always call returned `cleanup()` in `afterEach` to avoid leaking resources.
