Documents that share version numbers MUST be updated together. Add a checklist for updating versions and release dates.

### Terminology Consistency

Maintain a standard Terminology Reference and link to it from major documents. Use consistent capitalization and add new terms to the reference when needed.

### Formatting Standards

- Headers must include version, release date, status, and references
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Use consistent table formatting

### Cross-Reference Guidelines

Use relative paths for internal links and include file paths when referencing code. Keep documentation changes minimal and tied to Implementation Plan steps.
