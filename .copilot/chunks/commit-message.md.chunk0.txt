# Detailed Commit Message Prompt

## Prompt Template

```
I've completed work on [feature/fix]. Create a detailed commit message following ExoFrame conventions.

Before creating the commit:
1. Review what files changed: git status
2. Review the actual changes: git diff
3. Check Implementation Plan step if applicable

Then create a commit message with:

FORMAT:
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<detailed body explaining WHAT and WHY>

<footer with references>

TYPES: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, perf
SCOPE: component name (agents, flows, portal, mcp, cli, etc.)
