Remember Part IX where we created the `agents/` directory? We had documentation
   _for_ agents, but we were still treating it like regular docs—write it, forget it,

   Me: [finishes implementation]
   Me: [about to commit]
   You: "You did not follow instructions in agents/ folder. Why?"
   Me: ... 😳
   \```

I had just enhanced the agents/ system to make it MORE useful... without using
   the agents/ system to guide that enhancement. Peak irony.
