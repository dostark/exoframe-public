Show your thinking explicitly in <thinking> tags before each major step.

## Expected Response Pattern

Claude should show thinking for each phase:
```
<thinking>
ANALYZE phase:
- Found 12 files calling initTestDbService()
- No existing db.ts helper in tests/helpers/
- Risk: Circular dependencies if placed in wrong location
- Dependencies: All test files import from tests/helpers/

PLAN phase:
Tool calls needed:
1. grep_search for "initTestDbService" (get usage count)
2. Parallel read: tests/helpers/test_utils.ts, tests/db_test.ts (patterns)
3. Create tests/helpers/db.ts with exported helper
4. Update 2 representative files as examples
5. Run tests to verify
</thinking>

[then execute the plan with actual tool calls]
