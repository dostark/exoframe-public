## Example Usage (Topic Search)

**User:**
```
I need help with embeddings and RAG.

Use .copilot/cross-reference.md topic search:
- Topic: "embeddings" → .copilot/providers/claude-rag.md, .copilot/README.md
- Topic: "rag" → .copilot/providers/claude-rag.md

Read claude-rag.md sections:
- RAG Workflow (4 steps)
- Tools usage (inspect_embeddings.ts, inject_agent_context.ts)
- Token budget strategies

Then answer my questions about using embeddings.
```
