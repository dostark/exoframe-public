Do / Don’t
- ✅ Do keep doc updates minimal and scoped to the current task.
- ✅ Do ask 1–3 clarifying questions if the requirement is ambiguous before changing docs.
- ✅ Do rebuild `.copilot/manifest.json`, chunks, and embeddings after agent doc edits.
- ✅ Do add a regression test when a missing instruction caused a real failure.
- ❌ Don’t broaden scope into “general best practices” unrelated to ExoFrame.
- ❌ Don’t update many docs at once without a clear gap list.

Canonical prompt (short)
"Before implementing changes, run an Instruction Adequacy Check against .copilot/. If instructions are insufficient, patch .copilot/ with the smallest update needed (doc/template/cross-reference), rebuild/validate artifacts, then proceed with the primary task using the improved instructions."
