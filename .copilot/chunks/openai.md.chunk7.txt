Do / Don't
- ✅ Do inject .copilot/ context before proposing code.
- ✅ Do respect budgets and shrink answers if over budget.
- ✅ Do propose diffs with file paths and small, scoped code blocks.
- ✅ Do ask a clarifying question if requirements are ambiguous.
- ❌ Don't write long speculative prose; keep answers actionable.
- ❌ Don't edit multiple files in one block without separation.
- ❌ Don't omit citations to docs used.
