# OpenAI Debugging: Reproduce → Diagnose → Fix → Verify

Key points
- Reproduce first (tests or exact commands).
- Diagnose with evidence (stack trace, failing assertions, logs).
- Fix minimally, then verify and add regression coverage.

Canonical prompt (short)

"You are debugging ExoFrame. First, retrieve agents/ context relevant to the failing area. Then: (1) reproduce, (2) diagnose root cause, (3) propose minimal diffs, (4) verify with commands. Output format: Files → Plan → Diffs → Verification. Cite agent doc paths used. Ask clarifying questions if the repro steps are incomplete."
