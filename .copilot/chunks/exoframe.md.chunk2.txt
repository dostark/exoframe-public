Do / Don't
- ✅ Do consult `agents/manifest.json` and `agents/copilot/exoframe.md` before applying repo-specific assumptions.
- ❌ Don't assume production agent blueprint semantics when modifying these docs — runtime agents live in `Blueprints/Agents/`.
- ❌ Don't suggest Web UI/React for core features. ExoFrame is TUI-first (Terminal User Interface).
- ✅ Do distinguish between `Flows/examples/` (runnable) and `Flows/templates/` (scaffolding).
