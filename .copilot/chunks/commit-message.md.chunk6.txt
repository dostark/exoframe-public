Before creating the commit:
1. git status shows: tests/config_test.ts, tests/helpers/db.ts
2. git diff shows cleanup() now in try/finally block
3. Implementation Plan Step 4.3 (Config Loading) was affected

Create commit message:

Component: tests
Type: fix
```

**Expected Response:**

```bash
git add tests/config_test.ts tests/helpers/db.ts

git commit -m "fix(tests): ensure database cleanup in config tests

Fixes resource leak in config_test.ts where database connections
were not properly cleaned up when tests failed.

Problem:
- cleanup() was called conditionally after test assertions
- If assertion failed, cleanup() was never reached
- Database connections leaked, causing subsequent test failures
