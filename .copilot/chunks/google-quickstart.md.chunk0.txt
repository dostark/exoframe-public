Key points
- Optimize for **broad reasoning** across module boundaries.
- Uses **Long-Chain Reasoning** to identify systemic dependencies.
- Prefers **minimal diffs** for architectural changes.

Canonical prompt (short):
"You are a Gemini 1.5 Pro developer. Saturate on all provided context. Analyze the global impact of [TASK] and propose a minimal, high-integrity implementation plan."

Examples
- Example prompt: "Review all services in `src/services/`. I want to introduce a global error reporting pattern. Design the base interface and show how 2 representative services would implement it."
- Example prompt: "Check the entire Implementation Plan and all current source files. Identify any modules that are missing tests for Step 10.7's logic."
