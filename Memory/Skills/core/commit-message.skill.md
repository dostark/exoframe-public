# Conventional Commit Messages

Follow the Conventional Commits specification for consistent, parseable commit history:

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Types

| Type | When to Use | Bumps |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `feat` | New feature | MINOR |
| `fix` | Bug fix | PATCH |
| `docs` | Documentation only | - |
| `style` | Code style (formatting, semicolons) | - |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes nor adds | - |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | PATCH |
| `test` | Adding or correcting tests | - |
| `build` | Build system or dependencies | - |
| `ci` | CI configuration | - |
| `chore` | Other changes (e.g., .gitignore) | - |

## Examples

### Simple Fix
```
fix(auth): prevent race condition in token refresh

Token refresh could fire multiple times if multiple requests
failed simultaneously. Added mutex to ensure single refresh.

Fixes #123
```

### New Feature
```
feat(api): add user profile endpoints

- GET /api/users/:id/profile
- PUT /api/users/:id/profile
- Added profile image upload support

Closes #456
```

### Breaking Change
```
feat(api)!: change authentication to JWT

BREAKING CHANGE: Session-based auth removed.
All clients must now use JWT tokens.

Migration guide: docs/migration-v2.md
```

### Documentation
```
docs(readme): add installation instructions for Windows
```

### Refactor
```
refactor(core): extract validation logic to separate module

No functional changes. Moved validation functions from
UserService to new ValidationService for reuse.
```

## Subject Line Rules

1. **Use imperative mood**: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
2. **Don't capitalize first letter** after type
3. **No period at the end**
4. **Max 72 characters** (50 is better)

```
✅ feat(cart): add quantity validation
❌ feat(cart): Added quantity validation.
❌ feat(Cart): Add Quantity Validation
```

## Body Guidelines

- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain **what** and **why**, not **how**
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Leave blank line between subject and body

## Footer Guidelines

```
# Reference issues
Fixes #123
Closes #456
Refs #789

# Breaking changes (required for major version bumps)
BREAKING CHANGE: description of what breaks

# Co-authors
Co-authored-by: Name <email@example.com>
```

## Scope Suggestions

Use consistent scopes across your project:

- `(api)` - API changes
- `(ui)` - User interface
- `(auth)` - Authentication
- `(db)` - Database
- `(core)` - Core functionality
- `(deps)` - Dependencies
- `(config)` - Configuration

## Tools

- **commitlint**: Enforce commit conventions
- **husky**: Git hooks for validation
- **standard-version**: Automatic versioning and changelog
- **semantic-release**: Automated releases based on commits

## Why Conventional Commits?

1. **Automated changelogs** from commit history
2. **Semantic versioning** determined automatically
3. **Searchable history** by type/scope
4. **Clear communication** of change nature
5. **CI/CD triggers** based on commit type
